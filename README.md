SL(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping
=======================================

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.

Now the program supports cool options such as:
* **-n** allows to specify number of coaches
* **-s** is speed. Be careful, velocity is measured in Miles per hour, so it may be greater, than you expect!
* **-h** to see help page
